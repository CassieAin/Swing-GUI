# Swing-GUI
This is a repository with swing gui projects. 
First project is for Software Visualisation laboratory work. I had to create two modes - automatic and manual. In both modes a circle moves horizontally from left to the right and changes its size(increases). In automatic mode a circle changes its size on each position change, in manual mode a circle changes its size when it touches the border. I used swing library for that. Also, I didn`t use Swing designer, because I`m more comfortable with writing everything in code.
I hope it turned out to be fine!
